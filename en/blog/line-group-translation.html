        <p class="blog-article-lead">When your LINE group includes members who speak different languages, things start to break down quietly. Messages go unanswered because no one understood them. Plans get muddled by mistranslations. Important announcements slip through the cracks.</p>
        <p>This guide walks you through practical ways to add auto-translation to your LINE groups - so everyone stays on the same page without the constant copy-paste hassle.</p>

          <h2>The Short Answer: Which Option Is Right for You?</h2>
          <p class="section-lead">Before diving into the details, here's a quick way to decide.</p>

          <h3>The free LINE Interpreter works well if you...</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Only need one language pair (e.g., Japanese to English)</li>
            <li>Want to test things out without spending anything</li>
            <li>Care more about getting the gist than perfect translations</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>A multilingual translation bot (like KOTORI) is the better fit if you...</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Have three or more languages in the same group</li>
            <li>Need conversations to flow naturally for travel groups, international students, or multilingual teams</li>
            <li>Cannot afford the time it takes to copy-paste every message into a separate translation app</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <h2>Three Ways to Translate in LINE Groups</h2>

          <h3>1) Copy and paste into a translation app (manual)</h3>
          <p>The simplest approach, but also the most tedious. Copy a message, switch to Google Translate, paste it, copy the result, switch back to LINE, paste again - and by the time you're done, the conversation has moved on without you.</p>

          <h3>2) Add the free LINE Interpreter to your group (semi-automatic)</h3>
          <p>LINE offers official translation bots you can invite to a group. They're quick to set up, but come with some notable limitations.</p>

          <h3>3) Add a translation bot to your group (fully automatic)</h3>
          <p>A dedicated translation bot translates messages in real time within the group chat. This is where things get interesting for groups that deal with multiple languages or need reliable day-to-day communication.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Option 1: Using the Free LINE Interpreter</h2>
          <p>The LINE Interpreter is an official bot provided by LINE. Getting started takes just three steps:</p>
          <ol class="steps">
            <li>Add the Interpreter bot as a friend</li>
            <li>Invite it to the group you want to translate</li>
            <li>The bot automatically translates messages sent in the group</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Supported languages - check before you start</h3>
          <p>The LINE Interpreter primarily supports English, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), and Korean. If those cover your needs, it is a perfectly reasonable place to start.</p>
          <p>However, if your group includes speakers of Vietnamese, Tagalog, Portuguese, Thai, or other languages, the LINE Interpreter will not be enough on its own.</p>

          <h3>The hidden catch: only one official account per group</h3>
          <p>This is the limitation that catches most people off guard.</p>
          <p>LINE's system does not allow multiple official accounts in a single group chat. If your group already has an official account, such as a business bot or a scheduling service, you may not be able to add the translation bot without removing the existing one first.</p>
          <p>It is worth checking with your group members before making the switch, especially if the existing official account serves an important purpose.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Option 2: Using KOTORI, a Multilingual Translation Bot</h2>
          <p>KOTORI is a translation bot designed specifically for LINE groups. Invite it, and it starts translating. No app switching, no copy-pasting, no extra steps. You just keep chatting the way you always do.</p>

          <h3>Setup (under a minute)</h3>
          <ol class="steps">
            <li>Add KOTORI as a friend</li>
            <li>Invite it to your LINE group</li>
            <li>Start chatting and translations appear automatically</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>What makes KOTORI different</h3>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Context-aware translations: KOTORI considers the surrounding conversation, not just individual messages, so translations read more naturally</li>
            <li>Automatic language detection: Even when Japanese and English or other languages are mixed in the same group, KOTORI identifies each message and translates accordingly</li>
            <li>Built for group use: Designed for real-world scenarios including international student groups, travel planning chats, and workplace communication with multilingual staff</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5 Tips to Make Auto-Translation Actually Work</h2>
          <p>Adding a translation bot is only half the equation. How you write your messages makes a huge difference in translation quality. A few small habits can dramatically improve results.</p>
          <ol class="steps">
            <li>One message, one topic.</li>
            <li>Add English alongside proper nouns. For example, write Shibuya after the Japanese place name.</li>
            <li>Keep important announcements short and structured. Bullet points and simple sentences translate more accurately.</li>
            <li>For schedule changes, state only what changed and the deadline.</li>
            <li>When in doubt, ask yes-or-no questions.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

          <h3>Can I use LINE Interpreter and KOTORI in the same group at the same time?</h3>
          <p>In most cases, no. LINE's system restricts groups to a single official account, so you will need to choose one translation service per group.</p>

          <h3>How is my message data handled?</h3>
          <p>Always review each service's privacy policy before introducing it to your group. In KOTORI's case, messages and surrounding conversation context are sent to an external AI model for translation processing. On the Pro plan, stored messages are encrypted and retained for no longer than 7 days.</p>
          <p>When adding any translation bot to a group, it is good practice to let all members know in advance and get their agreement.</p>

          <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>If English, Chinese, or Korean covers your needs, the free LINE Interpreter is a solid starting point.</li>
            <li>For groups juggling three or more languages, or where natural context-aware translation matters, a dedicated translation bot is the way to go.</li>
            <li>Whichever you choose, remember the key constraint: one official account per group.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Removing translation friction from your group chat makes a bigger difference than you might expect. Give it a try and see how much smoother your conversations become.</p>

          <h3>Next Step</h3>
          <p>Add KOTORI as a friend and invite it to your group. That is all it takes to get started.</p>
